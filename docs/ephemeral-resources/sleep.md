# time_sleep (Ephemeral Resource)

Manages an ephemeral resource that delays creation and/or destruction, typically for further resources. This prevents cross-platform compatibility and destroy-time issues with using the [`local-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html).

## Schema

### Optional

- `close_duration` (String) [Time duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) to delay resource closing. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay. This value or any updates to it must be successfully applied into the Terraform state before destroying this resource to take effect.
- `open_duration` (String) [Time duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) to delay resource opening. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay.
- `outputs` (Map of String) (Optional) Arbitrary map of values that is used to be referenced by another resource/provider to introduce a dependency. This is only useful for a provider config to indirectly reference an attribute from another ephemeral resource, via this resource to apply a delay.
